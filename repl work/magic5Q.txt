3. A Magic Square

A magic square is a square array of numbers consisting of the distinct positive integers 1, 2, ..., n^2 arranged such that
the sum of the n numbers in any horizontal, vertical, or main diagonal line is always the same number.



a) Try to generate another 3 by 3 magic square.
b) Try to generate a 5 by 5 magic square (the sum of the rows, columns and diagonals should be 65).
c) Think about an algorithm that can generate magic squares for you.
d) Write a program that will generate a 3 by 3, 5 by 5 or 7 by 7 magic square.
