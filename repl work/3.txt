1D Arrays
Example 1
b) Write a program that dynamically allocates an array, enters its
content from the keyboard and print its content in reverse order.
Make sure to use delete[] when finished.
c) Write a program that dynamically allocates an array, initializes
all the locations with random number s from 1 - 50 and finds the sum
of all the elements of the array.  Make sure to use delete[] when
finished.
Example 2
Write a program that declares two dynamically allocated arrays of
integers and appends the second array at the end of the first one
to form the third one.  Make sure to use delete[] when finished.

2D Arrays
Example 1
b) Write a program that initializes a 2-dim array using random
numbers from 1 â€“ 1000 and finds the average of all the values.
Make sure to properly deallocate memory afterwards.

c) Write a program that initializes an n by n (square) 2-dim array
and prints the elements on its main diagonal. Make sure to properly
deallocate memory afterwards.
Example 2
Write a program that declares two dynamically allocated 2-dim arrays
of integers and appends the second array at the end of the first one
to form the third 2-dim array. Make sure to properly deallocate
memory afterwards.

Passing Arrays to Functions
Example 1
Declare and initialize an array of length 5. Send the array to the
function modifyArray that doubles each of the original values of
elements of the array. Now, print the new values of the array. Also,
send a single element of the array to the function modifyElement
that doubles the element received and prints it out. Now, print the
value of the element one more time after returning to the main function.
