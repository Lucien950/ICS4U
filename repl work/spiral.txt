2. Spirals

A spiral of numbers can start and end with any positive integers less than 100. Write a program which will accept two
positive integers x and y as input, and output a list of numbers from x to y inclusive, shown in a spiral. You may assume
that the end value is greater than or equal to the start value.

A spiral starts with the first number in the centre. The next number appears immediately below the first number.
The spiral continues with the numbers increasing in a counterclockwise direction until the last number is printed.
Read the input from the keyboard and display the output on the screen.
