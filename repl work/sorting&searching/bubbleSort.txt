1. Show the comparisons and exchanges that would take place in using a bubble sort to put the following data in ascending order.

    3       8       3       2       7       5

2. What changes would have to be made to the bubbleSort method in order to make it sort values in descending order?

3. A variation of the bubble sort is the cocktail shaker sort in which, on odd-numbered passes, large values are carried to the top of the list. On even-numbered passes, small values are carried to the bottom of the list. Show the first two passes on the following data.

     2       9       4       6       1       7       4.

Write a method shakerSort to implement the cocktail shaker sort algorithm to arrange an array of double values in ascending order. Use a boolean flag to stop processing once the items have been completely sorted.
