Exercises:

Q1: Create a void function cubeByPointer() that will find the cube of
a number using pointer as an argument of a function.
Add a test to main to show it works correctly.

Q2: Create a void function sumTwoInt() that will have 2 pointers as
arguments and will calculate the sum of two integers.
Add a test to main to show it works correctly.

Q3: Create a void function circle() that will have 3 pointers as
arguments, and will calculate the area and circumference of a circle.
Add a test to main to show it works correctly.

Q4: Create a boolean function quadEquation() that calculates the solutions
to quadratic equations. Arguments: The coefficients a, b, c and two
pointers for the solutions. Returns: false if no real solutions are
available, true otherwise.

Q5: The version of swap() listed below can be compiled without producing
any error messages. However, the function will not swap the values x and
y when swap(&x, &y) is called. What is wrong? Create a function that will
correctly swap the values.

void swap(float *p1, float *p2){
    float *temp;
    temp = p1;
    p1 = p2;
    p2 = temp;
}

Q6: Recall that if a and b are the real and imaginary parts of a complex
number (a + bi), then that number squared has the real and imaginary
parts a2 -b2 and 2ab, respectively. Find and fix the bug in the following
code:

void SquareComplex(double &a, double &b){
    // Squares a complex number a + bi
    a = a*a - b*b;
    b = 2*a*b;
}

HINT:  Try testing to check results first, and see what happens.
